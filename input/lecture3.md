## Some programming features in imperative languages
* Error handling
  - Exceptions (e.g., Java)
  - Set some global variable and abort computation (e.g., `errno` in C)
* Logging
  - Writing to a file
  - Having a global reference where to store the log

## What about in Haskell? (Pure functional language)
  - Data flow is explicit!
  - Let us take a concrete example

    ```haskell
    -- | Abstract syntax
    data Expr = Con Int | Div Expr Expr

    -- | Simple interpreter for simple arithmetic expressions
    interp :: Expr -> Int
    interp (Con i)     = i
    interp (Div e1 e2) = i1 `div` i2
      where
        i1 = interp e1
        i2 = interp e2

    -- | Successful division.
    ex_ok = Div (Con 10) (Con 5)
    ```

  - What if we accidentally divide a number by `0`?
    ```haskell
    -- | Crashing 'interp'!
    ex_crash = Div (Con 1) (Con 0)
    ```

## Handling errors explicitly

- The error handling mechanism that we consider is

  <div class="alert alert-info">
      If something goes wrong, the *whole* computation aborts!
  </div>

  (We do not consider recovery options.)
- Let us modify the interpreter to implement our error handling mechanism
  ```haskell
  data E a
    = Value a   -- ^ Regular result.
    | Wrong     -- ^ Exception.

  interpE :: Expr -> E Int
  interpE (Con i)     = Value i
  interpE (Div e1 e2) =
    case interpE e1 of
      Wrong -> Wrong
      Value i1 ->
        case interpE e2 of
          Wrong -> Wrong
          Value i2 ->
            if i2 == 0 then Wrong
            else Value $ i1 `div` i2
  ```

* Basically, **every recursive call needs to be checked for errors**!
  If one of them fails, then the program should abort.
* Consider what would happen if `Expr` had many other recursive constructors.
* One possible `run` function:

  ```haskell
  runE :: Expr -> IO ()
  runE e = case interpE e of
    Wrong   -> putStrLn "Something went wrong!"
    Value i -> putStrLn $ show i
  ```

## Logging

* We want to create a trace of the program:
  - Send messages to a log.
  - This information could be used to improve future interpreter optimizations
    or detection of bugs.
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        We want to send messages to a log at every instruction.
    </div>

- Let us modify the interpreter to log the number of divisions.
  ```haskell
  data L a = L a [String]

  interpL :: Expr -> L Int
  interpL (Con i)      = L i ["-- Hit Con --"]
  interpL (Div e1 e2)  =
    L (i1 `div` i2) $ concat
      [ [ "-- Hit a Div --" ]
      , [ "** Left recursive call **" ]
      , msgs1
      , [ "** Right recursive call **" ]
      , msgs2
      ]
  where
    L i1 msgs1 = interpL e1
    L i2 msgs2 = interpL e2
  ```

* Basically, the results of **every recursive call*** needs to be inspected to
  obtain the corresponding logs.
* Consider what would happen if `Expr` had many other recursive constructors.
* One possible *run* function:
  ```haskell
  runL :: Expr -> IO ()
  runL e = do
      putStr "The result is: "
      putStrLn $ show i
      putStrLn "Log:"
      mapM_ putStrLn msgs
    where
      L i msgs = interpL e
  ```

## Monads
* What are monads?
  - Structures useful to write programs with side effects.

* What is so special about them?
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
     They is general (support many different side-effects).
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
     Monads hide the plumbing (simplifies code).
    </div>

* How is so general?
   <div class="alert alert-danger">
    Monads control the order of evaluation.
   </div>
   Roughly speaking, the trick is how sequencing `;` is defined!
   Different definitions for `;` allow to handle different side-effects.

## Construction of programs

* Programs can be conceived as a *sequence* of instructions put together.

  <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-8"
       src="./assets/img/monad_seq.png">
  </div>

* **Every instruction computes some data**

* Importantly, **an instruction can affect what subsequent ones do**. More
  precisely,

  <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-10"
      src="./assets/img/monad_seq_2.png">
  </div>

  Functions `f(r1)` and `g(r2)` encode the dependency among instructions.

* What are the types for `f` and `g`, respectively?
  - Let us first introduce the types for instructions.

    <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-10"
      src="./assets/img/monad_seq_type_instr.png">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-6"
      src="./assets/img/monad_bind.png">
    </div>

* What is the type of the connector `(>>=)`?

    <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-10"
      src="./assets/img/monad_bind2.png">
    </div>

## Error handling

* The connector is placed in the "right place" to abort any computation as soon as
  an instruction fails.

    <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-10"
      src="./assets/img/monad_error.png">
    </div>

* A data type for handling errors:

  ```haskell
  data E a = Value a | Wrong
  ```

* Is `E a` a monad?
  - Not yet, we need to define the connector `(>>=)`.
  - Furthermore, monads have another primitive: `return`.  This primitive takes
    a value and *constructs an instruction that does nothing but producing that
    value*.
* In Haskell, a type constructor `m` is a monad if `return` and `(>>=)` are provided:

  ```haskell
  class Monad m where
     return :: a -> m a
     (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  ```

* What is the implementation of `return` and `(>>=)` for `E a`?

  ```haskell
  instance Monad E where
    return = Value

    Wrong   >>= f = Wrong
    Value a >>= f = f a
  ```
  Monad `E` is known as the `Maybe` monad.

* We need to add a primitive to make everything fail:

  ```haskell
  abort :: E a
  abort = Wrong
  ```
  This function is known as a *non-proper morphism*. In other words, non-proper
  morphisms are operations which are not `return` and `(>>=)`. They
  handle or affect the side-effectful part of the computation (in the case
  above, the failure!)

* The run function is mostly unchanged:
  ```haskell
  m_runE :: Expr -> IO ()
  m_runE e = case m_interpE e of
      Wrong   -> putStrLn "Something went wrong!"
      Value i -> putStrLn $ show i
  ```

## Error handling in the interpreter
* Let us rewrite the interpreter using the monad `E`

  ```haskell
  m_interpE :: Expr -> E Int
  m_interpE (Con i)     = return i
  m_interpE (Div e1 e2) =
      m_interpE e1 >>= \ i1 ->
      m_interpE e2 >>= \ i2 ->
      if i2 == 0 then abort
      else return (i1 `div` i2)
  ```

* Observe that the code has **minimum traces of error handling**, i.e., it does not inspect
  every recursive call for an error.

  - It is handled by the monad!
  - All the plumbing is hidden!


## Logging
* We would like to be able to control what information gets logged.

* We want to implement the side-effect of logging, i.e., the program computes
  the result of arithmetic expressions and, as a side-effect, generates a log
  of messages.

   <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-10"
       src="./assets/img/monad_msg.png">
   </div>


* Let us define `return` and `(>>=)` for `L`:

  ```haskell
  instance Monad L where
    return x       = L x []
    L x msgs >>= f =
      case f x of
        L y msgs' -> L y (msgs ++ msgs')
  ```

  - Function `return` produces the empty lists of logs (recall the monadic laws)
  - Function `(>>=)` concatenates the *logs*

* We need to implement a *non-proper morphism* which writes into the log -- we
  call it `msg`.

  ```haskell
  msg :: String -> L ()
  msg m = L () [m]
  ```

* Let us rewrite the interpreter using the monad `L`

  ```haskell
  m_interpL (Con i) = do
      msg "-- Hit Con --"
      return i

  m_interpL (Div e1 e2) =
      msg "-- Hit a Div --"             >>= \ _  ->
      msg "** Left recursive call **"   >>= \ _  ->
      m_interpL e1                      >>= \ i1 ->
      msg "** Right recursive call **"  >>= \ _  ->
      m_interpL e2                      >>= \ i2 ->
      return (i1 `div` i2)
  ```

* Observe that the code has **minimum traces about how the log is constructed**

  - It is handled by the monad!
  - All the plumbing is hidden!
  - It looks like imperative programming!

* Observe that we use many times ` m >>= \_ -> ... ` when `m` does not produce a
  useful value for the computation but a useful side-effect! (in this case,
  logging)

  - Monads use the operation `(>>)` to capture such situation
    and save us from writing functions which ignore arguments.

    ```haskell
    (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
    m1 >> m2 = m1 >>= \ _ -> m2
    ```

   Observe that function `(>>)` is a derived operation.

* Let us rewrite the interpreter once more

  ```haskell
  m_interpL (Div e1 e2) =
      msg "-- Hit a Div --"             >>
      msg "** Left recursive call **"   >>
      m_interpL e1                      >>= \ i1 ->
      msg "** Right recursive call **"  >>
      m_interpL e2                      >>= \ i2 ->
      return (i1 `div` i2)
  ```

* The run function is mostly unchanged.
  ```haskell
  m_runL :: Expr -> IO ()
  m_runL e = do
      putStr "Result: "
      putStrLn $ show result
      putStrLn "Messages:"
      mapM_ putStrLn log
    where
      L result log = m_interpL e
  ```


## Enter Monads

* **Definition**

  A data type `m` is a monad if it supports the following two operations:

  ```haskell
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  return :: a -> m a
  ```

  Functions `return` and `(>>=)` are known as *return* and the *bind*
  operations, respectively.

  Furthermore, these operation are required to fulfill the next laws:

  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Law</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tr>
  <td> Left identity: </td>
  <td>
  ```haskell
  return a >>= f â¡ f a
  ```
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td> Right identity: </td>

  <td>
  ```haskell
  m >>= return â¡ m
  ```
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td> Associativity: </td>
  <td>
  ```haskell
  (m >>= f) >>= g â¡ m >>= (\ x -> f x >>= g)
  ```
  </td>
  </tr>

  </table>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Check that <code>E</code> and <code>L</code> respects these laws.
  </div>

* **Terminology**
  - *Monadic* simply means pertaining to monads.
  - A *monadic type* has the form `m a` where `m` is an instance of the `Monad` type class;
    a *monadic value* has a monadic type.

* **Notation**

  Writing code with bind can look bloated:
  ```haskell
  m1 >>= \ r1 ->
  m2 >>= \ r2 ->
  m3
  ```

  Haskell supports *do-notation*, to write monadic code in "imperative style".

  ```haskell
  do r1 <- m1
     r2 <- m2
     m3
  ```

  Similarly,
  ```haskell
  m1 >>
  m2 >>= \ r2 ->
  m3
  ```
  can be written as
  ```haskell
  do m1
     r2 <- m2
     m3
  ```

## Revising interpreters with do-notation

* Error handling

  ```haskell
  m_interpE :: Expr -> E Int
  m_interpE (Con i)     = return i
  m_interpE (Div e1 e2) = do
      i1 <- m_interpE e1
      i2 <- m_interpE e2
      if i2 == 0 then abort
      else return (i1 `div` i2)
  ```

* Logging

  ```haskell
  m_interpL :: Expr -> L Int
  m_interpL (Con i)     = do
     msg "-- Hit Con --"
     return i

  m_interpL (Div e1 e2) = do
     msg "-- Hit a Div --"
     msg "** Left recursive call **"
     i1 <- m_interpL e1
     msg "** Right recursive call **"
     i2 <- m_interpL e2
     return (i1 `div` i2)
  ```

* It looks and feels like imperative programming (**but it is not!**)
* Monads alleviate all the *explicit data flow* required to implement error
  handling and logging.

## Monads and EDSL?

* In our examples above, we talk about monadic types, constructors, combinators,
  non-proper morphisms, and run functions:

  ```haskell
  -- Types
  data E Int

  -- Constructors
  return :: Int -> E Int
  abort  :: E Int
  -- Combinators
  (>>=) :: E Int -> (Int -> E Int) -> E Int
  -- Run function
  m_runE :: Expr -> IO()
  ```

  The type `E` and monadic operations `return` and `(>>=)` are *polymorphic*; in
  fact, monads require them to be (recall the type class `Monad`). However, when
  instantiate them to the type that we are interested in, i.e., in this case
  `Int`, we have a **EDSL**!

* <div class="alert alert-info">
  Monads are also useful to define EDSL in Haskell, but not every EDSL is
  necessarily a monad!
  </div>

* Are monads `E` and `L` shallow or deep embeddings?
  - Shallow!
    ```haskell
    data E a = Value a | Wrong
    ```
    An expression of type `E a` is either a value or indicates that something
    went wrong! It denotes its semantics! The same phenomenon occurs with `L a`.

## Deep embedding for error handling monad
* We start defining our data type

  ```haskell
  data E_deep a where
      -- Constructors
      Return :: a -> E_deep a
      Abort  :: E_deep a
      -- Combinators
      Bind   :: E_deep a -> (a -> E_deep b) -> E_deep b
  ```
  To implement this data type, we need to tell GHC to use the GADTs extension by
  adding
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
  ```
  at the beginning of the file. We will study more about GADTs in the course,
  but so far just notice the definition of `Bind`. It returns `E_deep b`
  although the data type is defined on `E_deep a` -- this is one of the key
  features of GADTs!

* The definition for `return`, `(>>=)`, and non-proper morphisms are trivial

  ```haskell
  instance Monad E_deep where
      return = Return
      (>>=)  = Bind

  abort_deep = Abort
  ```

* The *run* function is the interesting one.

  ```haskell
  run_deep :: Expr -> IO ()
  run_deep e =
    case to_semantics (interp_deep e) of
      Wrong   -> putStrLn "Something went wrong!"
      Value i -> putStrLn $ show i
    where
      -- It will not accept E_deep :: Int -> E Int due to Bind
      to_semantics :: E_deep a -> E a
      to_semantics (Return i) = Value i
      to_semantics  Abort     = Wrong
      to_semantics (Bind m f) =
        case to_semantics m of
          Wrong   -> Wrong
          Value i -> to_semantics (f i)
  ```


## Stateful computations

* There is no more imperative feature like having a global state and transforming
  it during a computation.

* Imagine that we want to count the number of divisions in our interpreter.
  - This could be useful for future optimizations.

* Assuming that we have a *unique global counter*, we would like to have a code
  like the following:

  ```haskell
  interpS (Con i)     = return i
  interpS (Div e1 e2) = do
      i1 <- interpS e1
      i2 <- interpS e2
      -- Read the global counter
      dvs <- get
      -- Increment it by one
      put (dvs+1)
      return (i1 `div`i2)
  ```

* We start by describing the type for stateful computations
  ```haskell
  data St s a
  ```
  A monadic expression of type `St s a` denotes an stateful computation, with
  state of type `s`, which produces a value of type `a`.

  The monad here is `St s`!

* Besides `return` and `(>>=)`, do we need non-proper morphisms?

  Yes! To control the side-effects, i.e., to read and write the state.

  ```haskell
  get :: St s s
  put :: s -> St s ()
  ```
  Observe that `get` returns the state as a value, while `put` returns `()`
  since it does not produce any value but modifies the state.

* To summarize, we have the following interface for stateful computations.

  ```haskell
  -- Type
  data St s a
  -- Constructors
  get    :: St s s
  put    :: s -> St s ()
  return :: a -> St s a
  -- Combinators
  (>>=)  :: St s a -> (a -> St s b) -> St s b
  ```

## Implementation (shallow embedding)

* Semantics for stateful computations

  What is the semantics of an instruction which can read and modify a given
  state?

  <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-6"
       src="./assets/img/monad_st_1.png">
  </div>

* An instruction produces some result, but also read or write into the state.

* Separating the reading and writing actions in the state, we can draw the
  graphics above as follows:

  <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-8"
       src="./assets/img/monad_st_2.png">
  </div>

* An instruction in the state monad is a function!

  - This reflects the fact that it depends on the state

* A program, i.e., a sequence of instructions built with the monadic operations,
  is also a function of type `s -> (a, s)`.

* More concretely,
  ```haskell
  data St s a = MkSt (s -> (a,s))

  get :: St s s
  get = MkSt $ \ s -> (s,s)

  put :: s -> St s ()
  put s = MkSt $ \_ -> ((),s)

  instance Monad (St s) where
    return x = MkSt $ \ s -> (x,s)
  ```

  Function `get` just places the state (receiving as an argument) as the result
  of the computation. Function `put` ignores the state given as an
  argument and sets the one given as an argument. Operation `return` does not
  change the state and produces as a result its argument.

* What about `(>>=)`?

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    The definition of `(>>=)` is responsible of
    passing along the state from one instruction to the other.
  </div>

  <div class="container">
     <img class="img-responsive col-md-12"
       src="./assets/img/monad_bind_st.png">
  </div>

  ```haskell
  MkSt m >>= k = MkSt $ \ s_1 -> let
      (a, s_2) = m s_1
      MkSt k_m = k a
    in k_m s_2
  ```

* A possible `run` function:

  ```haskell
  m_runS :: Expr -> IO ()
  m_runS e = do
      putStr "Result: "
      putStrLn $ show result
      putStrLn "Number divisions:"
      putStrLn $ show final_st
    where
      MkSt f = interpS e
      (result, final_st) = f 0
  ```


## Monads so far

* Imperative side-effects

  - Error handling
  - Logging
  - State

* The concept of monads goes beyond that

  - Security
  - Probability programming
  - Non-determinism
  - Software transactional memory

  We will see more of these monads later in the course.

* What about combining effects?

  - State, error, and logging!
  - Next lecture
