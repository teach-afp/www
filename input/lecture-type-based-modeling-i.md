# Type-based modeling

## Design of DSLs

* In our DSLs, we have tree important components: constructors, combinators, and
  run functions

* Sometimes, the DSL type-signature for combinators might allow to construct
  objects such that have *no semantics*

  <div class="container">
      <img class="img-responsive col-md-8 "
        src="./assets/img/badelem.png">
  </div>

* As a result, run functions need to *dynamically* check that objects "make
  sense" before *running* them

## A simple (non-monadic) DSL for integers and booleans expressions

* The DSL

  ```haskell
  -- Type of objects
  data Expr

  -- Constructors
  int  :: Int  -> Expr
  bool :: Bool -> Expr

  -- Combinators
  plus  :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  equal :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  if    :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr -> Expr

  -- Run
  type Value

  eval :: Expr -> Value
  ```

* Observe from the interface that the combinators can compose elements of
  different nature, which might trigger errors in the run function

  What is the *semantics* of the following expressions?

  ```haskell
  ifc (lit 3) (lit 42) (bool False)```

  ```haskell
  eqc (lit 3) (bool True)```

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
  The DSL allows to build both well- and ill-typed expressions!
  </div>

* We can start given a complex (and arguably wrong) semantics to *bad
  expressions* (JavaScript does that!), e.g., `1 + True == 1`, etc.

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
  We assume that ill-typed expressions have no semantics!
  </div>

  Therefore, the run function needs to trigger errors when expressions are bad.

## An EDSL implementation
[code](https://github.com/teach-afp/afp-code/blob/master/L13/Expr.hs)

* We implement `Expr` as follows

  ```haskell
  data Expr where
    LitI   :: Int  -> Expr
    LitB   :: Bool -> Expr
    (:+:)  :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
    (:==:) :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
    If     :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr -> Expr ```

* The interesting case is the run function

  ```haskell
  eval :: Expr -> Value
  ```

  Since expressions can be reduced to integers or booleans, an element of type
  `Value` is either an integer or a boolean.

  ```haskell
  data Value = VInt Int | VBool Bool ```

  The run function then checks that expressions are evaluated to *the expected
  type of values* at every combinator.

  ```haskell
  eval :: Expr -> Value
  eval (LitI n)       =  VInt n
  eval (LitB b)       =  VBool b
  eval (e1 :+: e2)     =  plus (eval e1) (eval e2)
    where plus (VInt n) (VInt m) = VInt $ n + m
          plus _        _        = error "plus: type error"
  eval (e1 :==: e2)    =  eq (eval e1) (eval e2)
    where eq (VInt n)  (VInt m)  = VBool $ n == m
          eq (VBool a) (VBool b) = VBool $ a == b
          eq _         _         = error "equal: type error"
  eval (If e1 e2 e3)  =  case eval e1 of
    VBool True   -> eval e2
    VBool False  -> eval e3
    _            -> error "if: type error" ```

* Ill-typed expressions raise errors when evaluating them

  ```haskell
  eBad2 = If (LitI 20) (LitI 1) (LitI 7) ```

  ```haskell
  > eval eBad2
  *** Exception: if: type error! ```

* The picture




* Can we avoid constructing bad expressions at all?

## A EDSL with type-aware combinators
[code](https://github.com/teach-afp/afp-code/blob/master/L13/Middle.hs)

* Now, for every type, we have a new *kind of expressions*

  ```haskell
  data ExprI  -- Integer expressions
  data ExprB  -- Boolean expressions ```

* Combinators can be defined on the right "kind of expressions"

  ```haskell
  (:+:) :: ExprI -> ExprI -> ExprI
  If    :: ExprB -> ExprI -> ExprI -> ExprI ```

  While this looks attractive, and indeed helps, it requires to introduce *many
  new constructors* to deal with all the possible "good" ways to build
  expressions.

  ```haskell
  data ExprI where
    LitI  :: Int -> ExprI
    (:+:) :: ExprI -> ExprI -> ExprI
    IfI   :: ExprB -> ExprI -> ExprI -> ExprI

  data ExprB where
    LitB :: Bool -> ExprB
    EqI  :: ExprI -> ExprI -> ExprB
    EqB  :: ExprB -> ExprB -> ExprB
    IfB  :: ExprB -> ExprB -> ExprB -> ExprB ```

  Observe the *reproduction* of equality constructors (`EqI` and `EqB`) and
  branches (`IfI` and `IfB`) depending on the type of arguments they take.

* There are two run functions, one for each type of expressions

  ```haskell
  evalI :: ExprI -> Int
  evalI (LitI n)    = n
  evalI (e1 :+: e2) = evalI e1  +  evalI e2
  evalI (IfI b t e) = if evalB b then evalI t else evalI e

  evalB :: ExprB -> Bool
  evalB (LitB b)    = b
  evalB (EqI e1 e2) = evalI e1  ==  evalI e2
  evalB (EqB e1 e2) = evalB e1  ==  evalB e2
  evalB (IfB b t e) = if evalB b then evalB t else evalB e ```

  Observe that `evalI` and `evalB` do not raise type-errors.

* We can use this EDSL to validate a value of type `Expr`

* In other words, we take a value of type `Expr` and map it into either `ExprI`
  or `ExprB`.

  If successful, we can run a value of type `Expr` using `evalA` or `evalB`, so
  no type errors!

  <div class="container">
      <img class="img-responsive col-md-10 "
        src="./assets/img/dsl_filter.png">
  </div>

* We need to write a function which *infers* the type for a value of type
  `Expr`

  ```haskell
  infer :: Expr -> ? ```

  There are three possible outcomes for `infer e`, i.e., it might produce an
  error (`e` has no type) or either a value of type `ExprI` or `ExprB`.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Expr as E

  data TypedExpr = TInt ExprI | TBool ExprB

  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr ```

  The easy cases are the constructors.

  ```haskell
  infer (E.LitB b)    = return $ TBool (LitB b)
  infer (E.LitI i)    = return $ TInt  (LitI i) ```

  For addition, we need both argument to be integer expressions.

  ```haskell
  infer (e1 E.:+: e2)  = do
   te1 <- infer e1
   te2 <- infer e2
   inferPlus te1 te2 ```

  Function `inferPlus` checks that both `te1 :: TypedExpr` and `te2 ::
  TypedExpr` are integers and, if that is the case, it constructs the
  corresponding value of type `ExprI`, i.e., a sum.

  ```haskell
  inferPlus :: TypedExpr -> TypedExpr -> Maybe TypedExpr
  inferPlus (TInt e1) (TInt e2) = Just (TInt (e1 :+: e2))
  inferPlus _         _         = Nothing ```

  In a similar manner, we write the cases for equality and branches.

  ```haskell
  infer (e1 E.:==: e2) = do
    te1 <- infer e1
    te2 <- infer e2
    inferEq te1 te2
  infer (E.If b t e)  = do
    tb <- infer b
    tt <- infer t
    te <- infer e
    inferIf tb tt te ```

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
  **Exercise**: write `inferEq` and `inferIf`
  </div>

* We write `eval` only for typed expressions so we guarantee no type errors

  ```haskell
  eval :: TypedExpr -> E.Value
  eval (TInt  ei) = E.VInt  $ evalI ei
  eval (TBool eb) = E.VBool $ evalB eb ```

* Problems with this approach:

  - Duplication of constructors to denote "the same operation" but on different
    type of expressions

  - It does not scale up for *type constructors* (e.g., lists, tuples, monads, etc.)

    For instance, if we want to introduce lists, we need to define a type for
    list expressions

    List of integers.
    ```haskell
    data ExprLI where
         EmptyLI :: ExprLI
         ConsLI  :: ExprI  -> ExprLI -> ExprLI ```

    ```haskell
    data ExprB where
         ...
         EqLI :: ExprLI -> ExprLI -> ExprB ```

    List of booleans.

    ```haskell
    data ExprLB where
         EmptyLB :: ExprLB
         ConsLB  :: ExprB  -> ExprLB -> ExprLB ```

    ```haskell
    data ExprB where
         ...
         EqLI :: ExprLI -> ExprLI -> ExprB
         EqLB :: ExprLB -> ExprLB -> ExprB ```

    What about having lists of lists?

    List of lists of integers.

    ```haskell
    data ExprLLI where
         EmptyLLI :: ExprLLI
         ConsLLI  :: ExprLI  -> ExprLLI -> ExprLLI ```

    ```haskell
    data ExprB where
         ...
         EqLI  :: ExprLI -> ExprLI -> ExprB
         EqLB  :: ExprLB -> ExprLB -> ExprB
         EqLLI :: ExprLLI -> ExprLLI -> ExprB ```

    List of lists of booleans.

    ```haskell
    data ExprLLB where
         EmptyLLB :: ExprLLB
         ConsLLB  :: ExprLB  -> ExprLLB -> ExprLLB ```

    ```haskell
    data ExprB where
         ...
         EqLI  :: ExprLI -> ExprLI -> ExprB
         EqLB  :: ExprLB -> ExprLB -> ExprB
         EqLLI :: ExprLLI -> ExprLLI -> ExprB
         EqLLB :: ExprLLB -> ExprLLB -> ExprB ```

    What about lists of lists of lists of integers/booleans?

## Enter GADTs
[code](https://github.com/teach-afp/afp-code/blob/master/L13/Typed.hs)

* We use GADTs of the form `Expr t`, where `t` is a Haksell type which indicates
  the value that the expression denotes

  ```haskell
  data Expr t where
    LitI   :: Int -> Expr Int
    LitB   :: Bool -> Expr Bool
    (:+:)  :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
    (:==:) :: Eq t => Expr t -> Expr t -> Expr Bool
    If     :: Expr Bool -> Expr t -> Expr t -> Expr t ```

   Observe constructors `LitI` and `LitB` produce integer and boolean
   expressions, respectively. The combinator `(:+:)` takes integer expressions,
   i.e., arguments of type `Expr Int`, and produces an integer expression as
   well. Equality of expressions of type `Expr t` requires that `t` supports
   equality in Haskell -- see the type constraint `Eq t`. Constructor `If` takes
   a boolean expression as the guard (`Expr Bool`) and both branches need to
   return the same type of expressions (`Expr t`).

   <div class = "alert alert-info">
   There is no way to construct ill-typed expression in `Expr t`
   </div>

* The run function is simply defined as follows.

  ```haskell
  eval :: Expr t -> t
  eval (LitI n)     = n
  eval (LitB b)     = b
  eval (e1 :+: e2)  = eval e1 +  eval e2
  eval (e1 :==: e2) = eval e1 == eval e2
  eval (If b t e)   = if eval b then eval t else eval e ```

* We can forget that an expression is typed

  <div class = "alert alert-info">
  To go from typed expressions to untyped ones is easy! (type elimination)
  </div>

  <div class = "alert alert-warning">
  To go from untyped expressions to typed ones is not straightforward! (type inference)
  </div>

* Type elimination

  ```haskell
  forget :: Expr t -> E.Expr
  forget e = case e of
    LitI n      -> E.LitI n
    LitB b      -> E.LitB b
    e1 :+: e2   -> forget e1 E.:+:  forget e2
    e1 :==: e2  -> forget e1 E.:==: forget e2
    If e1 e2 e3 -> E.If (forget e1) (forget e2) (forget e3) ```

* By doing so, we can reuse the pretty printing for the untyped version of
  `Expr`

  ```haskell
  instance Show (Expr t) where
    showsPrec p e = showsPrec p (forget e) ```

* Type inference is a bit more involved

  If `e` is an expression which produces a boolen, then

  ```haskell
  infer e :: Maybe (Expr Bool) ```

  If `e` is an expression which produces an integer, then

  ```haskell
  infer e :: Maybe (Expr Int) ```

  So, what is the type signature for `infer`?

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe ? ```

  The returning type depends on the (value of the) argument of the function!

* Challenge

   <div class = "alert alert-info"> Our inference function will have to convince
   the Haskell type checker to allow us to construct an element of `Expr t` from an
   untyped expression `E.Expr`.
   </div>


## Existential types

* When the returning type of a function depends on the (value of the) argument
  of a function, we can use *existential types* to make them type-check

  ```haskell
  data TypedExpr where
       (:::) :: forall t. Eq t => Expr t -> TypedExpr ```

  It is counter intuitive to use `forall t` to express an existential type. The
  contructor `(:::)` can be instantiated with any type `t` which supports
  equality.

  Observe that type `t` does not show up in the data type declaration
  `TypedExpr`. If we have a value `d :: TypedExpr`, we know that it is built
  with the constructor `(:::)`. Observe, however, we cannot guess which type `t`
  has been used, thus we only know that there *exists* a type `t` (with
  equality) which builds `d`!

* Typing `infer`

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr ```

* We add more information to the constructor `(:::)` to include not only the
  expression but its type as well

  ```haskell
  data Type t where
    TInt  :: Type Int
    TBool :: Type Bool

  data TypedExpr where
    (:::) :: forall t. Eq t => Expr t -> Type t -> TypedExpr ```

  Observe that `(e ::: te) :: TypedExpr` indicates that expression `e :: Expr t`
  has type `te :: Type t`.

* Observe that types `Type Int` and `Type Bool` have only one inhabitant,
  respectively (we exclude `undefined`).

  This kind of types are known as *singleton types*. Why is it useful?


## Singleton types

* There is a one-to-one correspondence between terms and types

  <div class="container">
      <img class="img-responsive col-md-10 "
        src="./assets/img/singleton.png">
  </div>


* This correspondence is useful to *guide Haskell's type-system* by coding using
  the singleton's types inhabitants.

* In our example, function `infer` is going to use them to indicate that
  (i) expressions are either typed as `Expr Int` or `Expr Bool`, and (ii) some
  expressions should have the same type.

## Implementing type inference

* We start by defining a mechanisms to tell Haskell that two types must be the
  same.

  ```haskell
  data Equal a b where
    Refl :: Equal a a ```

  `Equal a b` is a type of proofs that two types `a` and `b` are equal.  The
  only way to prove two types equal is if they are in fact the same, and then
  the proof is `Refl`.

  Evaluating one of these proofs to `Refl` will *convince GHC's type checker that
  the two type arguments are indeed equal* (how else could the proof be
  `Refl`?).

  For instance, if we have a proof `p :: Equal Int Int`, then we know that `p`
  is `Refl` since `Refl :: Equal Int Int` and it is the only inhabitant for that
  type.

  On the other hand, `p :: Equal Int Float` cannot be constructed. Do you see
  why?  The type `Equal Int Float` has no inhabitant, i.e., there is no
  constructor to build it (`Refl` does not work for this case).

* We construct a function which takes two types for expressions and hints
  Haskell if they have the same type

  ```haskell
  (=?=) :: Type s -> Type t -> Maybe (Equal s t) ```

  This function will only succeed when type `s` is equal to type `t`.

  How are we going to indicate that in the body of the function? After all,
  functions implementations do not talk about types!

  We have singleton types, so we can use their inhabitants to refer to types
  from the function body.

  ```haskell
  (=?=) :: Type s -> Type t -> Maybe (Equal s t)
  TInt  =?= TInt  = Just Refl
  TBool =?= TBool = Just Refl
  _     =?= _     = Nothing   ```

* In the `infer` function, we can make heavy use of the fact that pattern
  matching on a `Type t` or an `Equal s t` will tell GHC's type checker
  interesting things about `s` and `t`

* Inferring types for constructors

   ```haskell
   infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr
   infer e = case e of
     E.LitI n -> return (LitI n ::: TInt)
     E.LitB b -> return (LitB b ::: TBool) ```

   Because the use of `LitI` (`LitB`), GHC knows that `LitI n :: Expr Int`
   (`LitB b :: TBool`), and consequently has type `Type Int`. Consequently, we
   could have place `undefined` instead of `TInt` (`TBool`) -- after all, GHC's
   type system already knows everything -- and `infer` will still type checks.
   However, it might produce `infer` to crash later on (see other cases)

* Inferring types for addition

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr
  infer e = case e of
    ...
    r1 E.:+: r2 -> do
      e1 ::: TInt  <-  infer r1
      e2 ::: TInt  <-  infer r2
      return (e1 :+: e2 ::: TInt) ```

   By doing pattern-matching using `TInt`
   (i.e., `e1 ::: TInt` and `e2 ::: TInt`), we are telling GHC that
   `infer r1 :: Maybe TypedExpr` and `infer r2 :: Maybe TypedExpr`
    needs to construct integer expressions `e1 :: Expr Int` and `e2 :: Expr Int`, respectively.

* Inferring types for equality

  This case is interesting.

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr
  infer e = case e of
    ...
    r1 E.:==: r2 -> do
      e1 ::: t1    <-  infer r1
      e2 ::: t2    <-  infer r2
      ...
      return (e1 :==: e2 ::: TBool) ```

  We know that the result is something of type `Expr Bool`. We indicate by
  using `(:===:)` and `TBool` in the returned value.

  However, the expressions `e1` and `e2` might have any type (e.g., `Expr Int`,
  or `Expr Bool`) as long as they are the same. We hint that to GHC's type
  system by using function `(=?=)` and pattern-matching on its result.

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr
  infer e = case e of
    ...
    r1 E.:==: r2 -> do
      e1 ::: t1    <-  infer r1
      e2 ::: t2    <-  infer r2
      Refl         <-  t1 =?= t2
      return (e1 :==: e2 ::: TBool) ```

* Inferring types for branches

  We hint GHC that the guard needs to be boolean (by applying pattern-matching),
  and that the branches have the same type (by applying function `(=?=)` and
  pattern-matching on its result).

  ```haskell
  infer :: E.Expr -> Maybe TypedExpr
  infer e = case e of
    ...
    E.If r1 r2 r3 -> do
      e1 ::: TBool <-  infer r1
      e2 ::: t2    <-  infer r2
      e3 ::: t3    <-  infer r3
      Refl         <-  t2 =?= t3
      return (If e1 e2 e3 ::: t2) ```

## Type checking and evaluation

* We can do type checking by inferring a type and comparing it to the type we
  expect.

  ```haskell
  check :: E.Expr -> Type t -> Maybe (Expr t)
  check r t = do
    e ::: t' <- infer r
    Refl     <- t' =?= t
    return e ```

* Evaluation

  As we did before, we first type-check an expression and then run it.

  ```haskell
  evalT :: E.Expr -> Maybe E.Value ```

  Recall that `E.Value` has the constructors `VBool Bool` and `VInt Int`.

  In this light, if an expression `E.Expr` has type `Type Int`, then `evalT`
  should return `VInt n` (for some `n`).

  ```haskell
  evalTI :: E.Expr -> Maybe E.Value
  evalTI e = do
    i <- check e TInt
    return (E.VInt $ eval i) ```

  Observe the use of `TInt` to hint GHC's type system.

  Similarly, we have a function for expression with type `Type Bool`.

  ```haskell
  evalTB :: E.Expr -> Maybe E.Value
  evalTB e = do
    b <- check e TBool
    return (E.VBool $ eval b) ```

  Observe that we are calling `eval` from our original approach (the one that
  might report type-errors). However, this function is not going to raise any of
  them!

  Function `evalT` simply tries to type expressions as `Type Bool` or
  `Type Int` and returns the appropriated value.

  ```haskell
  evalT :: E.Expr -> Maybe E.Value
  evalT e = evalTB e  `mplus`  evalTI e ```


## Summary

* Adding type-inference / type-checking to DSLs
  - Avoid constructing semantically bad entities
  - No type-errors reported by the run function

* GADTs

  - It allows to express some invariants about how constructors and combinators
    should work (e.g., the guard of a branch is a boolean expression)

* We verify that entities built with the DSL interface are well-typed, i.e.,
  they accommodate to the GADTs invariants

  - We implement type-inference for the elements built with the DSL interface

  - We use existential types to give a type to the inference function

  - We use singleton types to hint GHC's type-system about the expected types
    for the GADTs elements

  - We use a proof of equality to hint GHC's type-system when two GADTs values
    should have the same type.
